        We had to use our perseverence and determination to find sponsors and
        to build a robot that worked well, which allowed us to reach 5th place
        and win the highest rookie seed award at the Montreal Regional.

      <p class="no-margin">Theme: <em>Recycle Rush</em></p>
      <p class="no-margin">
        <em>Recycle Rush</em> is played by two Alliances of three
        Teams each. Alliances compete simultaneously to score points by stacking
        Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling
        Containers, and properly disposing of Litter, represented by pool
        noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of
        the game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams
        in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.
