        It's with a lot of perseverence and determination the we were able to
        conceive, finance and build a simple, reliable and performing robot. At
        the Montreal Regional, we were astonished by our performance since we
        were the winning alliance's captain and went to the Saint-Louis
        Chamionship.

      <p class="no-margin">Theme: <em>Stronghold</em></p>
      <p class="no-margin">
        <em>Stronghold</em> is played by two alliances of three teams each. Alliances
        compete against each other to breach their opponents’ defenses, known as
         outer works, and capture their tower. They score points by crossing
         elements of their opponents’ outer works, scoring boulders in their
         opponents’ tower goals, and surrounding and scaling their opponents’
         tower itself.
