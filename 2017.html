        PLS' 2017 season was filled with emotions. After the six build weeks,
        we performed well at the Montreal Regional and got selected by the
        first alliance. Despite our defeat in the final round, we went to the
        Saint-Louis Chamionship thanks to the Engineering Inspiration Award we
        won, which recognizes team that were able to show respect and
        recognition to engineers in the community.
